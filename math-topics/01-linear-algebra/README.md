# Linear Algebra

## Overview
Linear algebra studies vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. It is essential for machine learning, graphics, optimization, and deep learning.

## Key Concepts
- Vector spaces
- Linear transformations
- Matrices and operations
- Rank, nullity, basis, dimension
- Determinants and inverses

## Formulas
### Dot Product
u · v = Σ uᵢ vᵢ

### Matrix Multiplication
(AB)ᵢⱼ = Σ Aᵢₖ Bₖⱼ

### Determinant (2×2)
det(A) = ad − bc

### Inverse (2×2)
A⁻¹ = (1/(ad − bc)) [[d, -b], [-c, a]]

## Applications
- Machine learning models
- PCA / SVD
- 3D graphics
